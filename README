Loan Risk Prediction Project 📊💼

Overview
This project aims to help banks and customers make informed decisions regarding loan eligibility. It uses machine learning algorithms to assess the risk of loan repayment and provides recommendation systems for better loan choices. 📉🤖

Features

Loan Risk Prediction: Analyzes customer data to predict the risk of loan default using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). 🏦🔍

Loan Recommendation System: Suggests the best loan options based on eligibility and personal factors such as the number of dependents. 💡💳

Customer-friendly Chatbot: Explains why a customer may not qualify for a loan and offers alternatives based on eligibility criteria. 🤖💬

Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 🌐

Backend: Python, Scikit-learn 🐍📚

Database: SQL 🗃️

How It Works

Customer Data: Data such as income, credit history, and number of dependents is collected.

Data Processing: Data is processed and analyzed using machine learning models to assess risk.

Prediction: The system predicts whether the customer is likely to repay the loan.

Recommendation: Based on eligibility, customers are recommended loan options that fit their profile. ✅💸

Future Enhancements
